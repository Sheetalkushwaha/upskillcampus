# Forecasting-smart-city-traffic-pattern
My project was that we are working with the government to transform various cities into smart cities. The vision is to convert it into a digital and intelligent city to improve the efficiency of services for the citizens. One of the problems faced by the government is traffic. 
The government wants to implement a robust traffic system for the city by being prepared for traffic peaks. They want to understand the traffic patterns of the four junctions of the city.
This project is about forecasting and prediction of traffic patterns using machine learning algorithm by training machine learning model using Training data and then making prediction on the Test data.
